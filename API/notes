1. We need to understand the requirement at hand.

Daily accurate percentage profit = 0.0526 | 5.26% 

Notes:
    An investment is made by a person into the application.
    The app has 2 games (Evening | Morning).

    the percentage profit per day is set to 5.62% of the investment.
    Tweak.
        The percentage is split into 2 un-even parts that are given on the 
        2 matches provided in the day, both parts put together will make it 
        5.16% the profit of a changing account balance.

    Approach:
        we need to create 2 functions, morning and evening profit calculator functions.
        The morning percentage given is calculated and added onto the account balance, 
        the new account balance is then used to calculate the new profit, the new profit based off 
        the new profit is then added onto the account balance to give the total daily account balance.

        let's have a function to calculate the morning profit.
